# TVC-LQR

This repository contains a python simulation for a TVC rocket using LQR. 
None of this code has been tested or flown, all code is to be used at your own
risk.

This simulation contains a simple model of a TVC rocket and the state matrices for the rocket. When run, it will output the optimal gain (K) and plot a graph of the state throughout the simulation
