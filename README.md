<h1 align="center">TVC-LQR</h1>

<p align="center">This is a python LQR sim which is currently set up for a TVC (thrust vector controlled) rocket. The simulation can be modified for any system by changing the matrices defined at the top of the code: A, B, Q, R, x, xf. If you wish to change this from a TVC sim, you can remove the "hardware constraints" from the top of the code. The simultion is discrete.
