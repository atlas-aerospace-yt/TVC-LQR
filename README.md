# TVC-LQR

## DISCLAIMER: Use this code at your own risk - by using this code you take full responsibility for your use of this code!
</p>

This repository contains a python simulation for a TVC rocket using LQR. 

This simulation contains a simple model of a TVC rocket and the state matrices for the rocket. When run, it will output the optimal gain (K) and plot a graph of the state throughout the simulation
